# Logic Expression Normalizer

## Description

Logic expression normalization (simplification) is an important step to reduce the original expression into a canonical normal form with fewer terms and operations. This way, the same expression can be implemented using fewer logic gates, which means higher reliability and lower manufacturing cost. In this project, I have created a normalizer for logic expressions using the Quine-McCluskey method.
